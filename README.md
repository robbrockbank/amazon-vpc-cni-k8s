## Setup
Download the latest version of the [yaml](./config/) and apply it the cluster.
```
kubectl apply -f aws-k8s-cni.yaml
```
Launch kubelet with network plugins set to cni (`--network-plugin=cni`), the cni directories configured (`--cni-config-dir` and `--cni-bin-dir`) and node ip set to the primary IPv4 address of the primary ENI for the instance (`--node-ip=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4)`).  It is also recommended to set `--max-pods` equal to the number of ENIs for the instance type * (the number of IPs per ENI - 1) [see](./pkg/awsutils/vpc_ip_resource_limit.go) to prevent scheduling that exceeds the IP resources available to the kubelet.

The default manifest expects `--cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d` and `--cni-bin-dir=/opt/cni/bin`.

L-IPAM requires following [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html):

 ```       
 {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
         "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
         "ec2:AttachNetworkInterface",
         "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
         "ec2:DetachNetworkInterface",
         "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
         "ec2:DescribeInstances",
         "ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute",
         "ec2:AssignPrivateIpAddresses"
     ],
     "Resource": [
         "*"
     ]
 },
 {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": "tag:TagResources",
     "Resource": "*"
 },
```

## Building

* `make` defaults to `make build-linux` that builds the Linux binaries.
* `make docker-build` uses a docker container (golang:1.10) to build the binaries.
* `make docker` will create a docker container using the docker-build with the finished binaries, with a tag of `amazon/amazon-k8s-cni:latest`
* `unit-test`, `lint` and `vet` provide ways to run the respective tests/tools and should be run before submitting a PR.

## Components

  There are 2 components:
  
  * [CNI Plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/network-plugins/#cni), which will wire up host's and pod's network stack when called.
  * L-IPAM, which is a long running node-Local IP Address Management (IPAM) daemon, is responsible for:
    * maintaining a warm-pool of available IP addresses, and
    * assigning an IP address to a Pod.
